<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    The advent of the internet and its rapid penetration into every aspect of our lives has redefined the way we interact, work, and access information. One industry that has been revolutionized by the power of the digital world is healthcare. Online healthcare, a fusion of technology and medicine, has the potential to transform the patient experience, making healthcare more accessible, efficient, and personalized than ever before.
</p>

<h2>Our Goal</h2>
<p>
    We want to provide some tools for people seeking medical treatment without actually going to the hospital. For elderly people living alone, we will notice their emergent healthy questions and give them help on time. For people who just need some medicine but not necessarily professional treatment from doctors, they would not need to wait in long lines in the hospital and waste medical resources which would be more valuable for severe patients.
</p>

<h2>My Work</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Brainstorming and Ideation.</li>
    <li> Need-finding.</li>
    <li> Made the prototype.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Need-finding</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most people do not have family doctor.</li>
        <li>Long wait time in the hospital.</li>
        <li>Questionnaire results justify the needs.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Brainstorming and Ideation</h3>

<h4>User Differentiation</h4>
<p>Different users should be categorized into different groups to be provided more specialized services.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Young.</li>
        <li>Middle-aged.</li>
        <li>Senior.</li>
        <li>Mental illness.</li>
        <li>Physical illness.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Core Services</h4>
<p>Providing consultation service to help know the users in a finer granularity.</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Know more about the situation:</li>
        <li>This applies to mental illness, the patients could do a questionnaire in advance.</li>
        <li>Provide options to upload some files that help diagnose, e.g. pictures, patient history, etc.</li>
        <li>Help guide what to do next:</li>
        <li>We can use an interactive AI, e.g. chatGPT, to interact with the users and suggest them what to do next, e.g. video call with a doctor, go take pills directly.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Core Services</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make reservations for both online and offline diagnose and appointment management.</li>
        <li>Choose a doctor to make video calls.</li>
        <li>Multiple Language options.</li>
        <li>The doctors can prescribe electronically to patients.</li>
        <li>The patients could make comments on the doctors and rate them.</li>
        <li>Medical records access.</li>
        <li>Video consultations.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>External Support</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Medical equipment.</li>
        <li>Baby cameras.</li>
        <li>Physical SOS button (for those seniors live alone).</li>
        <li>When doctor prescribes medicine to a patient online (Delivery service for drugs).</li>
        <li>Deliver what the users order and rent.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h4>Privacy and Security</h4>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>SSL Encryption.</li>
        <li>HIPAA Compliance.</li>
        <li>Data Backup and Recovery.</li>
        <li>Account Verification.</li>
        <li>Secure Payment Gateway.</li>
        <li>Automatic Payment Reminders.</li>
        <li>Invoicing and Receipts.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
<ol>
    <li>when I did the brainstorming, I found that collaborarion really matters.</li>
    <li>When I did the need-finding and prototype, I found that heuristic analysis really helpful.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prototype</h2>

<img src="assets/images/Ask_doc.jpg" style="margin-right: 30px;" alt="Ask_doc">
<img src="assets/images/Me_tab.jpg" style="margin-right: 30px;"  alt="Me_tab">
<img src="assets/images/Prescription.jpg" style="margin-right: 30px;"  alt="Prescription">

<h2>Heuristic Analysis</h2>
<p>Analysis was first performed on the UI design sketches, and then on first draft of the Prototype, involving in two phases: Inspection and Walkthrough.</p>

<h3>Consistency</h3>
<p>Internal consistency throughout menus and sub menus by positioning items relatively in the same place.</p>
<p>External consistency is maintained by standard web and app design Iconography and Images that most users are already familiar with.</p>

<h3>Minimalism</h3>
<p>The application uses a clean design, omits any information that is not necessary and ensures white space while reading important information (prescriptions, doctor descriptions, ratings, etc), to not overwhelm them with a lot of content.</p>

<h3>Freedom</h3>
<p>Privacy was a major concern for users when we did our phase 1 evaluation.</p>
<p>A delete history button has therefore been added in the accounts option, so that patients can delete any information they don’t want us to store.</p>
<p>They can also delete their ratings.</p>

<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>Patients who might not be sure about who they should consult have two options:</p>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Describe their problem in the chat and ask for suggestions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Go through the department description, in case the users are not comfortable sharing personal/sensitive information.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>Recognition and Mapping</h3>
<p>Recognition has been for the users by using standard web and app design Iconography and Images that most users are already familiar with.</p>
<p>This also provides mapping from real world phenomenons to the application.</p>

<h3>Visibility</h3>
<p>In order to give control back to the users we ensure the users always have access to their entire medical and prescription history.</p>
<p>They can selectively give access to their history to any doctor they wish.</p>
<p>They can ask for updated on the prescription right form the app.</p>

<h3>Error Prevention and Recovery</h3>
<p>Error prevention is ensured by user ratings for doctors.</p>
<p>The users can only rate those doctors they have consulted with using the platform.</p>
<p>Ratings also ensure error recovery as the platform and hospitals can use patient reviews to decide whether to host a doctor or not.</p>

<h3>Help</h3>
<p>We aim to both proactive and reactive help approaches.</p>
<p>Proactive help to help users answer Frequently asked health questions.</p>
<p>Reactive help for questions related to using the application, and questions not in the FAQ’s.</p>
